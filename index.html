      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        New technology and the commercialization of satellite systems have led
        to an increasing number of satellites being launched into space. When
        objects
        break apart or collide in orbit, they create what is known as space
        debris. More research is needed to understand the effects space debris
        has on
        satellites, but raising awareness is where it begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orbital Watch is a visual tool created to simulate simple collisions
        between satellites and space debris. Developed using the Unity game
        engine and Blender for 3D modeling, Orbital Watch provides a visual
        representation
        of collisions in space. Satellite models have been imported from NASA's
        publicly available 3D model library.
      </p>
      <p>The client requesting the project was Pål Gunnar Ellingsen, an
        Associate
        professor within satelite technology and remote sensing at the
        Department of
        Electrical Engineering at UiT</p>

          <p>
            The main challenge of simulating collisons between space debris is
            the lack
            of research on how collisions make objects behave in space. Objects
            moving
            through orbit typically travel at extremely high speeds - as much as
            7
            kilometers per second (25 000 kilomters/hour). Comparatively a rifle
            bullet
            moves at the speed of 1.2 kilomters/second, a mere fraction of this.
            When
            two objects collide in orbit at such velocities, the realtive
            collision
            speed might reach as much as 15 kilomters/second (54 000
            kilometers/hour).
          </p>
          <p>
            Simulating such high speed collisions can therefore be difficult.
            Both when
            simulating objects through physical experiments, as well as when
            visualizing
            collisions with tools such as Orbit Watch. It is hard to mimic
            collision
            effects that there is little to no real-world data available.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to create a visual tool for space debris collisions, it has
            been
            important to set aside attempts to capture how objects actually
            behave in
            space. The project has been commissioned to simulate simple
            collisions, not
            to provide accurate representations of how objects physically behave
            in
            orbit when colliding.

      <h2>Future Development</h2>
      <p>
        Although Orbital Watch was created to simulate simple collisions, it
        holds
        potential for further development — possibly as part of a Master of
        Applied
        Science assignment. Further development would likely require additional
        time and resources
        to
        reach a higher level of simulation fidelity.
